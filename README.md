# PerfectImageGrid.js

Javascript code to generate a perfect image grid from a list of images in a div.
The grid is justified (all the lines have the same width), does not have any hole,
and the images on a line all have the same height.
Also, the images can be down-scaled to fit, but never up-scaled.
